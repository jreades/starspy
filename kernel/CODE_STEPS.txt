Steps for writing this code

Variable = kernel.triangular (starting points, values, bandwidth = some default, output points = starting points by default)

1. Check dimensions of starting points

2. Check that #Columns in starting points = #Columns in values

3. Run the KDE function (triangular in this case) to get the shapes of the PDFs
    - This will use the starting points, the values, and the bandwidth

4. Output an array
	Use the starting points
	OR
	Use the user-defined output points
